    Python School Project - Handwriting English letter identifier.
    A Deep Learning Computer Program that gets a dataset consists of Handwriting Lowercase English Letters -
    The database is based on the EMNIST library: images of handwritten English letters a-z.
    The program is learning to identify the handwritten English letters, show the accuracy and loss it got during the train process,
    then do test to check the model and at the end predicts an image of a letter the user want or a random letter image from the dataset, or from new images.
    It does it using classification. Classifies the lowercase letters so that they are divided into lowercase categories in English.
    26 categories = 26 letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x , y, z.
